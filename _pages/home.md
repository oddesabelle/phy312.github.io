# Welcome to CX Team
The Complex Systems Team (CX Team) started out in 2007 as one of the three Complex Systems subgroups of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/instrumentationphysicslab/">Instrumentation Physics Laboratory</a> at the <a href="http://nip.upd.edu.ph">National Institute of Physics</a>, <a href="https://upd.edu.ph">University of the Philippines Diliman</a>. It is currently headed by Dr. May T. Lim.

## About CX Team
The group investigates sociotechnical systems that are rich in empirical data. We are actively involved in data mining social media, agent-based modeling of ecological systems, agent-based modeling of vehicular traffic, and analyzing complex networks. 
(see [Research](research)).

<!--**Project 1:** *Technical design & system deployment*. Headed by Francis Aldrine Uy, Ph.D. (Mapua University).\
**Project 2:** *Design and analysis of algorithms*. Headed by by May T. Lim, Ph.D. (UP Diliman).\
**Project 3:** *Information exchange platform for the public*. Headed by Noriel Christopher C. Tiglao, Ph.D. (UP Diliman).\
**US Principal Investigator:** Alexandre Bayen, Ph.D. (UC Berkeley).

The project team proposes a capacity-building endeavor by creating a data analytics and allied platforms. At the end of the work, the project aims to have a working system that research teams can expand and train others on the processes.

The Project aims to produce the following:
* Urban data inventory in the Philippines
* Specification of customized traffic inference algorithms for Manila
* Definition of systems requirements for information exchange with public sector
* Design of travel demand forecasting algorithms for Manila
* Algorithms for computation of dynamic traffic assignment, user equilibrium
* Pilot training on Transportation Decision Support Systems
* Recommendations (policy) development based on algorithm performance
* Program report and recommendation report (for future work)
